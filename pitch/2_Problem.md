# The Problem

## The Fashion Industry's Environmental Crisis

### 🗑️ Textile Waste
- Denmark generates 85,000 tonnes of textile waste annually
- Only 7% of textiles are currently recycled
- Fast fashion contributes to growing waste

### 🔍 Market Fragmentation
- Sustainable brands struggle to reach consumers
- Consumers find it difficult to verify sustainability claims
- Limited access to repair services

### 💔 Disconnected Solutions
- No unified platform for sustainable fashion
- Repair services are scattered and hard to find
- Lack of educational resources for consumers

*"The fashion industry accounts for 10% of global carbon emissions, and Denmark aims to reduce its fashion footprint by 2030"*
